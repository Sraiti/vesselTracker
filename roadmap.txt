1 - save data to database instead of files and create the vessel_location table and make relation to vessel table 
    PROGRESS :  vessel location tables has been created .
                and the latest_position column has been added to the vessel table .

2 - use DB as a cache for the vessel data instead of Fetching the mmsi data from the API every time .
    PROGRESS : the vessel fetcher has been modified to fetch the vessel data from the DB and not the API .
    KNOWN BUGS : 
        - Some vessels get fetched by the api even that they are in the DB .
        - Bad performance for the search endpoint .
        - workers and http client should be optimized . (goal here to reach the base line of the maersk api)


3 - make endpoints to query the vessel location data 
4 - make front-end to visualize the data 
5 - a ranking system for tracking vessels via the ais stream and this system uses two criteria : 
    - the number of number of appearances of the vessel in the requested schedules 
    - the last seen date of the vessel
