1 - save data to database instead of files and create the vessel_location table and make relation to vessel table 
    ✅ DONE:
        - Vessel location tables has been created
        - Latest_position column has been added to the vessel table

2 - use DB as a cache for the vessel data instead of Fetching the mmsi data from the API every time
    ✅ DONE:
        - Vessel fetcher modified to fetch vessel data from DB first
        - Removed redundant position enrichment lookup
        - Performance optimized:
            * Vessel data fetching reduced to ~1-4ms
            * Total processing time (excluding Maersk API) under 5ms
    
    KNOWN BUGS: 
        ✅ FIXED:    - Bad performance for the search endpoint
        ✅ FIXED:    - Workers and http client should be optimized (goal: reach Maersk API baseline)

3 - make endpoints to query the vessel location data 
    TODO:
        - Design API endpoints for location queries
        - Implement filtering and sorting options
        - Add pagination support

4 - make front-end to visualize the data 
    TODO:
        - Create vessel tracking dashboard
        - Implement map visualization
        - Add real-time updates

5 - implement ranking system for tracking vessels via the AIS stream using:
    TODO:
        - Track vessel appearance frequency in schedules
        - Monitor last seen dates
        - Create scoring algorithm
        - Implement priority-based tracking
